At Relay For Life events, communities across the globe come together to honor cancer survivors, remember loved ones lost, and fight back against a disease that has already taken too much. This community event is held on a local high school track or park and consists of inspiring ceremonies, activities and fun, and teams of friends, families, and co-workers coming together to finish the fight against cancer! The funds raised truly make a difference in the fight against cancer - just ask one of the nearly 14 million cancer survivors who will celebrate another birthday this year! Each Relay For Life event is special to its community, but the movement's true power lies in the combined commitment of thousands of participants, volunteers, and supporters to help the American Cancer Society save lives from cancer. Commitment requires regular check ins with your team lead and/or ACS staff member (in person, over the phone or via email) during Relay Season (January-August depending on event) and 2-3 hours a week of additional volunteer efforts. Schedule of work is up to you.

SPECIFIC TASKS INCLUDE: Collaborate with ceremonies lead and activities lead regarding schedule of events and activities to plan and implement Relay For Life event activities So...at this point you may be wondering... WHAT IS RELAY FOR LIFE ? At Relay For Life events, communities across the globe come together to honor cancer survivors, remember loved ones lost, and fight back against a disease that has already taken too much. This community event is held on a local high school track or park and consists of inspiring ceremonies, activities and fun, and teams of friends, families, and co-workers coming together to finish the fight against cancer! The funds raised truly make a difference in the fight against cancer - just ask one of the nearly 14 million cancer survivors who will celebrate another birthday this year! Each Relay For Life event is special to its community, but the movement's true power lies in the combined commitment of thousands of participants, volunteers, and supporters to help the American Cancer Society save lives from cancer. Commitment requires regular check ins with your team lead and/or ACS staff member (in person, over the phone or via email) during Relay Season (January-August depending on event) and 2-3 hours a week of additional volunteer efforts. Schedule of work is up to you. For more information on Relay For Life and/or the American Cancer Society, please visit www.relayforlife.org/sanfranciscoca or contact Alexis Faughn at alexis.faughn@cancer.org Sound like something you'd be great at?? Perhaps you'd only like a bite-size piece of this role?? Perhaps you & a family member or a friend interested in working on this together??

Normally we have a brief meeting with all students at the start of the club meeting, to listen to the song we are working on learning, and to make a plan. Then we divide up into different classrooms -- guitars in one room, pianos in one, bass and drums in another. You would take a small group of students (2-8 students) and help them learn their part for the song. We are talking SUPER basic chords. Then at the end of club meeting we all join back together and try playing the song together! Would love to have someone who can come every week during the school year, more or less. It could be during lunch (12:05-12:50) on Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays or Fridays, or it could be after school (3:15-4:45) on Mondays or Thursdays. Or some combination of those!

If you would like to tangibly enhance the life of someone who needs it the most, we encourage you to contact us and learn more about this truly unique opportunity.</p><p>As a peer support volunteer, you will:</p><p>--Go through the internationally-recognized Shanti Model of Peer Support training</p><p>--Be matched 1-on-1 with a client to whom you will provide companionship, a non-judgmental ear and light practical assistance</p><p>--Join a community of thoughtful, supportive volunteers and staff</p><p>For this program, we ask for a commitment of 2 to 6 hours a week for at least 6 months. We also organize support groups once a month, and ask all volunteers to attend. The 2-6 hours can be done according to volunteer&#39;s schedules--a lot of our volunteers visit their clients on weekends or evenings--so it&#39;s definitely flexible.</p><p>If you decide to enroll in the Peer Support Program there is a mandatory volunteer training. Each interested volunteer must attend ALL of the training dates listed below.</p><p><strong>The dates for the next trainings are as follows:</strong></p><p><strong>\u00b7 Friday, March 24th from 6pm-9:30pm</strong></p><p><strong>\u00b7 Saturday, March 25th from 9am-6pm</strong></p><p><strong>\u00b7 Sunday, March 26th from 9am-6pm</strong></p><p><strong>\u00b7 and Wed., March 29th from 6pm-9:30pm</strong></p><p></p><p>The purpose of this training is to prepare volunteers to work with individuals who are isolated, or living with life-threatening illnesses and other disabilities. The training will supply information about challenges our clients face as well as teach communication and listening skills through a variety of interactive exercise. The training is pretty intensive, but our volunteers typically find it to be an enriching, community-building experience.</p><p>You can make an invaluable difference to someone who needs it the most - and have your life changed in the process.</p><p>Shanti was founded in 1974. Since its inception, Shanti has trained more than 18,000 individuals in the Bay Area and 600 organizations around the world in compassionately providing emotional and practical support to clients grappling with life-threatening illnesses, social isolation, other disabilities and poverty.

It is hard to quantify how significant he is and I can't imagine what my life would be like without him.\\\" - Shanti client For 42 years, Shanti peer support volunteers have been providing emotional and practical support to people living with life-threatening illness, as well as LGBT isolated seniors and adults with disabilities, much like you would support a friend or family member in need. If you would like to tangibly enhance the life of someone who needs it the most, we encourage you to contact us and learn more about this truly unique opportunity. As a peer support volunteer, you will: --Go through the internationally-recognized Shanti Model of Peer Support training --Be matched 1-on-1 with a client to whom you will provide companionship, a non-judgmental ear and light practical assistance --Join a community of thoughtful, supportive volunteers and staff For this program, we ask for a commitment of 2 to 6 hours a week for at least 6 months. We also organize support groups once a month, and ask all volunteers to attend. The 2-6 hours can be done according to volunteer's schedules--a lot of our volunteers visit their clients on weekends or evenings--so it's definitely flexible. If you decide to enroll in the Peer Support Program there is a mandatory volunteer training. Each interested volunteer must attend ALL of the training dates listed below. The dates for the next trainings are as follows: \u00b7 Friday, March 24th from 6pm-9:30pm \u00b7 Saturday, March 25th from 9am-6pm \u00b7 Sunday, March 26th from 9am-6pm \u00b7 and Wed., March 29th from 6pm-9:30pm The purpose of this training is to prepare volunteers to work with individuals who are isolated, or living with life-threatening illnesses and other disabilities. The training will supply information about challenges our clients face as well as teach communication and listening skills through a variety of interactive exercise. The training is pretty intensive, but our volunteers typically find it to be an enriching, community-building experience.
